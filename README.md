<h1> Hello! You have somehow found my website.  <br> </h1>
<h2>If you want you can visit <a href = "/Blog/home"> My blog </a> <br>
In my blog you can find what I've been up to recently. Soon I'll add more posts and upload all my repositories on that site. 

It is in a very primitive phase, but still, it exists :)
